# HyperFS
A simple HTTP server for static files.

HyperFS is a very simple http server that simply serves the files in the directory
it is run from. It is primarily intended as a development tool similar to using
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. But it is a single lightweight executable written in rust.

To be honest, part of the motivation was to just so I could try out rust.
